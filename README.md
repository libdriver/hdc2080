## LibDriver HDC2080

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/hdc2080/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The HDC2080 device is an integrated humidity and temperature sensor that provides high accuracy measurements with very low power consumption in a small DFN package. The capacitive-based sensor includes new integrated digital features and a heating element to dissipate condensation and moisture. The HDC2080 digital features include programmable interrupt thresholds to provide alerts and system wake-ups without requiring a microcontroller to be continuously monitoring the system. Combined
with programmable sampling intervals, a low power consumption, and a support for a 1.8-V supply voltage, the HDC2080 is designed for battery operated systems.The HDC2080 provides high accuracy measurement capability for a wide range of environmental monitoring and Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as smart thermostats and smart home assistants. For designs where printed-circuit board (PCB) area is critical, a smaller CSP package option is available thru the HDC2010 with complete software compatibility with the HDC2080.

LibDriver HDC2080 is a full-featured driver of HDC2080 launched by LibDriver.It provides the function of reading temperature , relative humidity and interrupt function. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
float temperature;
float humidity;

/* basic init */
res = hdc2080_basic_init(HDC2080_ADDRESS_0);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* delay 2000ms */
    hdc2080_interface_delay_ms(2000);

    /* read data */
    res = hdc2080_basic_read((float *)&temperature, (float *)&humidity);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)hdc2080_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    hdc2080_interface_debug_print("hdc2080: %d/%d.\n", (uint32_t)(i + 1), 3);
    hdc2080_interface_debug_print("hdc2080: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature);
    hdc2080_interface_debug_print("hdc2080: humidity is %0.2f%%.\n", humidity); 
 
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)hdc2080_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
#### example shot

```C
uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
float temperature;
float humidity;

/* shot init */
res = hdc2080_shot_init(HDC2080_ADDRESS_0);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* delay 2000ms */
    hdc2080_interface_delay_ms(2000);

    /* read data */
    res = hdc2080_shot_read((float *)&temperature, (float *)&humidity);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)hdc2080_shot_deinit();

        return 1;

    /* output */
